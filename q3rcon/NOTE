It is impossible to find a Python program that works on Urban Terror, for whatever reason. For this reason, JavaScript and NodeJS are required to get RCON working, which is not too much a problem. This will not be intensive as only administrators are permitted to use rcon; additionally, any information obtained by RCON will be available to all, not merely upon request--if that makes sense.
